# The Y-64 class-two architecture reference manual

## Scope

This manual describes the Y-64 processor and system-on-chip internals for Lunota / OSMORA
chip and firmware engineers. This manual also describes various component interfaces.

## Terminology

```
Processing domain)
    A processing domain (PD) is a single processor core [unit of execution]
    consisting of its own register bank, ALU, control unit, etc.

Bootstrap PD)
    The bootstrap processing domain is the first processing domain to be brought
    up when the system is powered up.

PC inhibit line)
    Describes an electrical connection to a processing domain that results in
    the program counter being held if set.
```

## Machine power-up state

When power is driven to the SoC, the RESET signal is immediately asserted to the
bootstrap processing domain. This in turn results in all registers (excluding FP,
SP, TT, and control registers) being initialized to a fixed bit-pattern [0x1A1F1A1F1A1F1A1F].

All other processing domains are to have their PC inhibit line asserted until woken up by
the bootstrap processing domain.
