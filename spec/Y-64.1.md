# The Y-64 class-one architecture reference manual

## Scope

This manual describes the Y-64 processor internals for firmware and system software
developers

## Interrupt and event management

Y-64 is an interrupt-driven architecture, in other words, it is capable of performing a task
and being interrupted to handle external or internal events. Events related to the current
execution are known as *synchronous* events. Events that are external to the current execution
are known as *asynchronous* events.

An asynchronous event may indicate the need for servicing of a request by an external peripheral
(e.g., timer, hard drive, network card, etc). A synchronous event may be the result of an error
during execution (e.g., divide error, memory access violations, etc) or even from a special interrupt
instruction.

### Interrupt service table

The interrupt service table is a data structure used by the processor to identity routines (known as interrupt
service routines) that are invoked during events.

```
BITS       NAME       PURPOSE
------------------------------------------------------
0          Present    Indicates if entry is used
8:1        Zero       Must be zero
16:9       Reserved   Reserved for future use
80:17      ISR        Interrupt service routine base
------------------------------------------------------
```

### Interrupt table register (ITR)

The interrupt service register is an internal processor register used to maintain the
base address of the interrupt service table. It is to be zero on start up. Any event that
occurs while ITR refers to an invalid base address shall result in the processor branching
to the reset vector which in turn results in the machine entering a warm reboot.

## Cache unit

The SoC contains a cache unit initially used as main memory during early system operation. Firmware on
a non-embedded chip revision is to manage the transition between the usage of this cache unit and external
RAM.

The cache unit is wired to a *cache gate* (CG) line as well as a *cache enable* (CE) line. The CG line
may only be asserted but not de-asserted, it is responsible for enabling usage of external RAM. The CE
line is responsible for enabling and disabling caching within the internal cache unit. During non-embedded
bring up, the CG line is asserted and platform firmware jumps to a trampoline located in external RAM
before flushing the cache and asserting CE.
