# The Y-64 class-one architecture reference manual

## Scope

This manual describes the Y-64 processor internals for firmware and system software
developers

## Cache unit

The SoC contains a cache unit initially used as main memory during early system operation. Firmware on
a non-embedded chip revision is to manage the transition between the usage of this cache unit and external
RAM.

The cache unit is wired to a *cache gate* (CG) line as well as a *cache enable* (CE) line. The CG line
may only be asserted but not de-asserted, it is responsible for enabling usage of external RAM. The CE
line is responsible for enabling and disabling caching within the internal cache unit. This must be asserted
alongside the CG line during non-embedded bring up. Once CG+CE are high, firmware must jump to a trampoline
located in external RAM before flushing the cache.
