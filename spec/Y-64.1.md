# The Y-64 class-one architecture reference manual

## Scope

This manual describes the Y-64 processor internals for firmware and system software
developers

## Cache unit

The SoC contains a cache unit initially used as main memory during early system operation. Firmware on
a non-embedded chip revision is to manage the transition between the usage of this cache unit and external
RAM.

The cache unit is wired to a *cache gate* (CG) line as well as a *cache enable* (CE) line. The CG line
may only be asserted but not de-asserted, it is responsible for enabling usage of external RAM. The CE
line is responsible for enabling and disabling caching within the internal cache unit. During non-embedded
bring up, the CG line is asserted and platform firmware jumps to a trampoline located in external RAM
before flushing the cache and asserting CE.
