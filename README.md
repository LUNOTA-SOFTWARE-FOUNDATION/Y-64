# The Y-64 architecture

The Y-64 architecture is a 64-bit system-on-chip architecture designed for personal computing with
the goal of providing certain similarities to x86-64 while being far more compact and stripped down.

## Project structure

This repository contains the implementation of the architecture in various forms (i.e., virtual machines,
toolchains, hardware descriptions, etc).

- spec/: Specifications and documentation

## Specification classes

- Class 0: Instruction set architecture
- Class 1: Firmware and system software guide
- Class 2: Processor internals
